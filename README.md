## Project Title: Searching a Keyword in a filesystem

This is my project for the course System Programming in 5th Semester.

We all have been through a time when we write some code or some text. But we forget where we placed it on our PC. We also come across the moment when we save a file or directory with a certain name but don’t exactly remember where we stored it. This is where my project ‘Searching a Keyword in a File System’ comes handy. The Project is implemented in C language on Ubuntu OS and uses some system functions to achieve the task of searching the keyword.
The project does two things:
1) Finds the file/Sub-directory name that matches the keyword and returns it’s path.
2) It opens the all the readable files in the directory provided and returns the path if the keyword is present within particular file(s).

The project is made on linux based UBUNTU OS.

Compile the program as follows:
```
gcc -o main main.c 
```
